      Planet Keeper is focused on tracking the population status of our
      pollinators around the globe and contributing to their preservation. Data
      loss, data categoriazation, and data integrity are major concerns when
      collecting, storing, and analyzing data for our pollinators around the
      globe. Arweave is a global computer that allows us to store data
      permanently while giving the participants the ability to contribute to
      that data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the 4,000+ species of bees in the United States, we only know the
      population status of roughly 7% of those bees, meaning that we do not
      understand the population trends of 93% of the bees in the United States.
      These percentages are likely similar around the world and not just in the
      United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission is to preserve the pollinators through data and education.
      First, we need data to understand the population status's of our
      pollinators, and second we need education to expand the role, purpose, and
      scope of the pollinator data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our first step is to onboard individuals to Arweave to allow them to
      contribute to the data. This includes farmers, hobbyists, educators,
      researchers, and creditable organizations.
