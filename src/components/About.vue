    Planet Keeper is focused on tracking the population status of our
    pollinators around the globe and contributing to their preservation. Data
    loss, data categoriazation, and data integrity are major concerns when
    collecting, storing, and analyzing data for our pollinators around the
    globe. Arweave is a global computer that allows us to store data permanently
    while giving the participants the ability to contribute to that data.
