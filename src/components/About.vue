      Pollinator is focused on tracking the population status of our pollinators
      around the globe and contributing to their preservation. Data loss and
      data integrity are major concerns when collecting, storing, and analyzing
      information for our pollinators. Arweave is a global computer that allows
      us to store data permanently while giving the participants the ability to
      contribute to that data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the 4,000+ species of pollinators in the United States, we only know
      the population status of roughly 7% of those pollinators, meaning that we
      do not understand the population trends of 93% in the United States. These
      percentages are likely similar around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission is to preserve the pollinators through data and education.
      First, we need data to understand the population statuses, and second we
      need education to expand the role, purpose, and scope of the pollinator
      data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our first step is to onboard individuals to Arweave so that they can
      contribute to the newly created global pollinator database. This includes
      farmers, hobbyists, educators, researchers, credible organizations, and
      you.

      There are two key aspects to the pollinator data though, the first is the
      trends of the populations, and the second if the food sources for the
      pollinators. Some pollinators are only specific to certain areas of the
      globe, and if their foods are disappearing, then the pollinators will as
      well.
